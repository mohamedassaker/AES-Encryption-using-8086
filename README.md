# An-8086-Implementation-of-a-128bit-Advanced-Encyption-Standard-AES-
AES is a symmetric block cipher used by the U.S. government to protect classified information and 
is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. 
The AES operates on a 128 bit bursts as well as 128 bits key. Using 8086 assembly language, we implemented this encryption.
